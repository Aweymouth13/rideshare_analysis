# NYC Vehicle for Hire Data Analysis and ML Model

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the New York City 'Taxi Data', specifically vehicle-for-hire (Uber/Lyft) data from January 1, 2022, to August 31, 2023. The project (will) encompasses a comprehensive statistical analysis followed by the development of a machine learning model. The model is intended for open use, allowing anyone to leverage our insights and predictions.

## Current Project Status
- Finished exploratory ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process
  [x] Downloaded raw data
  [x] Cleaned and preprocessed the data
  [/] Conducted preliminary measures and analysis
